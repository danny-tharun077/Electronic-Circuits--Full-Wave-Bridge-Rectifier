## STEPS FOR SIMULATION:
1.	Open the Ltspice software
  
2.	FileNew Schematic
	
3.	Click component symbol  to browse and select the components
   
4.	Find the diode or diodes from the component list and place them.
   
5.	Click OK and place the component
    
6.	Search for resistor from component menu or from the tab icons
    
7.	Place the resistors
    
8.	Search for capacitor from the component menu or from the tab icons
    
9.	Place the capacitors
    
10.	Use ctrl + R to rotate the components
    
11.	Use wire symbol  to connect the components as per the circuit diagram
    
12.	Right click each components to give the values
    
13.	Use run button  to run the simulation
    
14.	Set the step time and click ok
    
15.	Output dialog box will open
    
16.	In the output dialog box right click and select add traces
  
17.	Node voltages and current of each components names will be displayed.
    
18.	Select the required node voltages (V(n001)) to get the waveforms.
   
19.	To get the voltage across a component the name of the trace should represent both the nodes. example V(n001,n002))

## OUTPUT:
## WITHOUT FILTER:
